## 📘 Lesson 1: Python Basics

### ✅ 1. Printing Messages
You can show messages on the screen using `print()`.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### ✅ 2. Variables
Variables are used to store data.

```python
name = "Uday"
age = 25
```

### ✅ 3. Data Types
Common Python data types:
- `str` → Text → `"hello"`
- `int` → Whole numbers → `10`
- `float` → Decimal numbers → `3.14`
- `bool` → Boolean (True/False) → `True`

```python
language = "Python"
version = 3.11
is_fun = True
```

### ✅ 4. Simple Math
Python can be used like a calculator.

```python
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)
```

## 🧠 Assignment

Practice what you learned with these 3 beginner tasks:

### 1. Even or Odd Checker
Ask the user for a number and print if it’s even or odd.

### 2. Grade Evaluator
Ask for a score between 0–100 and print the grade:
- A: 90+
- B: 80–89
- C: 70–79
- D: 60–69
- F: Below 60

### 3. Password Checker
Ask the user to enter a password. If it matches `"python123"`, print `"Access granted"`; else print `"Access denied"`.
